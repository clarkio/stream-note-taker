A tool that will help record stream events and notes while live streaming

- Commands to use in chat:
    - `!mark`: used to create "chapters" for events that occurred on stream. This outputs to a file called `segments.md` and in a table format. This can be used as chapters within the description of YouTube recordings for the stream

        Example format: `| 00:00:00  | Kick it off |`

    - `!note`: used to create a note of something that happened or was learned during the stream. This outputs to a file called `notes.md`.

        Example format:  `- this is a note (added by [@clarkio](https://twitch.tv/clarkio))\n`
